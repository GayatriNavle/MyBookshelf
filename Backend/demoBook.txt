Welcome to the magical adventure of Harry and Doraemon.
It was a peaceful morning in the Gryffindor common room.
Harry was flipping through his Potions notes when he heard a strange sound.
WHOOOSH! Suddenly, a peculiar pink door appeared out of nowhere.
The door opened, revealing a round blue creature with a big smile.
“Hello! I’m Doraemon, and this is my Anywhere Door,” the creature said cheerfully.
Harry blinked in confusion. “What… what kind of magic is this?” he asked.
“It’s not magic—it’s future technology!” Doraemon replied.
Harry, ever curious, stepped closer to inspect the door.
“Where does it lead?” Harry asked.
“Anywhere you want!” Doraemon answered proudly.
Before Harry could respond, Nobita popped out from behind Doraemon.
“Let’s explore Hogwarts!” Nobita exclaimed excitedly.
“Wait, you can’t just wander around,” Harry said, alarmed.
But curiosity got the better of him. “Fine, let’s see where this leads,” he said.

Harry stepped through the Anywhere Door with Doraemon and Nobita.
The trio found themselves in the bustling village of Hogsmeade.
“Wow, is that butterbeer?” Nobita asked, pointing at floating mugs.
“Yes, but be careful—it’s for wizards only,” Harry warned.
Doraemon pulled out a gadget shaped like a teacup.
“Don’t worry! My Wizard Cup Gadget will help us fit in,” he said.
Suddenly, the air grew cold, and a dark shadow loomed over them.
“It’s Lucius Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed, gripping his wand.
Lucius sneered, “Wizards don’t mingle with Muggles.”
Before he could cast a spell, Doraemon sprang into action.
“Magic Shield Gadget!” he shouted, creating a shimmering barrier.
Lucius’s spell bounced harmlessly off the shield.
“Brilliant gadget!” Harry said, impressed.
Nobita, however, was trembling behind Doraemon.
“Can we leave now?” he whispered.

The Anywhere Door opened again, this time leading to the Forbidden Forest.
“This place is dangerous,” Harry said, lighting his wand.
Doraemon, unfazed, activated his Night Vision Goggles Gadget.
With the forest illuminated, they saw strange creatures lurking.
“Are those spiders?” Nobita yelped, clutching Doraemon’s tail.
“They’re Acromantulas,” Harry explained. “Stay close.”
Suddenly, a group of centaurs emerged from the shadows.
“Intruders!” one of them bellowed, drawing an arrow.
Doraemon quickly pulled out his Translator Gadget.
“We come in peace,” Doraemon said in perfect Centaurian.
The centaurs hesitated, lowering their weapons.
“We will allow you to pass,” their leader said.
“Your gadgets are as good as spells,” Harry said, grinning.
Nobita, however, kept looking over his shoulder nervously.
“Let’s get out of here before something else shows up,” he said.
They stepped back through the Anywhere Door, relieved to be safe.

Their next stop was the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts.
The room transformed into Doraemon’s futuristic home.
“How does it know what you want?” Doraemon asked, amazed.
“It’s magical—it responds to your needs,” Harry explained.
Nobita tried sitting on a floating chair but promptly fell off.
“Looks like I’m not cut out for wizard life,” Nobita sighed.
Doraemon pulled out a gadget called the Gravity Stabilizer.
“Try now,” he said, activating the device.
This time, Nobita floated gracefully onto the chair.
Harry laughed. “Maybe gadgets are better than magic!”
Suddenly, Ron burst into the room, holding a broken wand.
“Can you fix this?” he asked.
Doraemon nodded and used his Time Cloth Gadget.
Ron’s wand was restored instantly. “Wow, thanks!” Ron said.
“These gadgets are amazing,” Hermione said, entering the room.
Doraemon blushed at the praise.

While exploring Hogwarts, Doraemon and Nobita stumbled upon a Quidditch match.
“What’s this game?” Nobita asked, watching players zoom by on broomsticks.
“It’s Quidditch—the most popular wizarding sport,” Harry explained.
Doraemon, intrigued, pulled out a Flying Broom Gadget.
“Let’s give it a try,” he said, handing it to Nobita.
Nobita wobbled in the air but managed to stay afloat.
“You’re a natural,” Harry said, laughing.
Suddenly, the Golden Snitch flew past.
“Catch it, Nobita!” Doraemon shouted.
Nobita chased the Snitch clumsily but eventually caught it.
“That was incredible!” Hermione said, clapping.
Nobita beamed with pride, despite his shaky landing.
“You’d make a great Seeker,” Ron said, grinning.
The match ended, and the crowd erupted in cheers.
“Your gadgets make everything easier,” Harry said.
“But magic is still pretty cool,” Doraemon replied.
